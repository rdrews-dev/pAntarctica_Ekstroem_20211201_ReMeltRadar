\subsection{Objectives}
Ocean induced melting at the bottom of Antarctic ice shelves accounts for approximately half of the total ice-mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, processes that govern the heat exchange at the ice-ocean interface are notoriously difficult to observe. Consequently, the coupling between ice- and ocean models rely on a number of poorly constrained parametrizations which require more observational support both spatially and temporally. Moreover, ice-shelves decelerate the ice discharge from tributary glaciers, and the magnitude of deceleration depends on the mechanical rigidity of the ice shelf itself. This rigidity is governed by a non-newtonian, temperature dependent and anisotropic ice-shelf rheology. This also requires observations as model calibration model calibration to todays ice thickness or velocities is strongly underconstrained.
ReMeltRadar's objectives are (1) to quantify the spatial variable ocean-induced melting from seasonal to centennial timescales, (2) understanding processes that govern ocean-induced melting at sub-kilometers scales, and (3) to map spatial variability in ice anisotropy across different flow regimes. We aim to achieve these objectives with a combination of methods that include model-data fusion (i.e., inversion of the radar stratigraphy using ice-flow forward models), instrument development (i.e., a novel radar combined with an autonomous rover), and profiling with radar polarimetry that is sensitive to the crystal lattice structure.
\subsection{Field work}
The area of interest is the Ekström Ice Shelf, East Antarctica, using the Neumayer station as a logistical hub for field surveys on the ice shelf and in the grounding zone. The first field season took place from 11/2021 – 01/2022. Repeat measurements are planned for the successive field season in 2022/23. 
Field work was conducted in parts using Skidoos and the Hiluxes operating directly from Neumayer station. In a second phase, data were collected after a 120 km traverse with snow tractors from Neumayer to the southern grounding line of the Ekström Ice Shelf (Fig. 1). Logistics were efficiently shared with the GrouZe Project operating in the same area.

\section{GPR data collection and examples}
\label{SecGpr}
\textbf{This section was written by Inka Koch}
(\href{mailto:inka.koch@uni-tuebingen.de}{\color{blue}{Email Me}})\\
\subsection{Pulse Ekko data collection: overview}
Ground penetrating radar data was collected with the Pulse Ekko System primarily using unshielded antennaes with frequencies of 50 (100) MHz (Table \ref{Table_PE}). A shielded antennae of 250 MHz was only employed once on the traverse to the grounding line (Table \ref{Table_PE}). For the unshielded anteannae the radar transmitter and receiver were set up on a Nansen sled whereas the GPS was set up on the back of the skidoo (Fig. \ref{fig_PE}). This setup of the GPS on the skidoo was determined by the length of the cable from the control unit, which needed to be operated by a person sitting on the back of the skidoo. The system needed to be triggered manually due to a limitation with the system software that did not allow free run data collections for time windows larger than 2000 ns (*note: the system software update should be ready and tested mid 2022*). More than 100 km of data were collected with 50 MHz by skidoo driving at ca. 10 km per hour triggering the radar manually approximately every second (Fig. \ref{fig:overview}). This allowed imaging of the ice shelf base up to depths of approximately 1000 m close to the ice shelf grounding line (Fig. \ref{fig_PE_bulge}) and detailed imaging of internal ice shelf structures close to the ice shelf surface (Fig. \ref{fig_IRH1}). The Pulse Ekko was hence the diagnostic tool with which a location with steep side walls (henceforth called 'the buldge' as in Fig. \ref{fig_PE_bulge}) could be selected. This section was subsequently surveyed by the rover and a HF ApRES radar (see Section \ref{SecHFApRES}). In addition a fine grid was surveyed close to the location of the bulge  (Fig. \ref{fig:overview}) to select a location with a basal step (Fig. \ref{fig_PE_ApRES_site}) where an ApRES was installed for overwintering. The 50 MHz radar data does not only show the base of the ice shelf, internal layers have also been imaged in the top ca. 200 m of the ice shelf (Fig. \ref{fig_IRH1} and Fig. \ref{fig_IRH2}). Hereby some unusal cross-cutting structures have been detected in the near-surface (Fig. \ref{fig_IRH2}).  
\subsection{Pulse Ekko data collection: technical settings}
The 50 MHz data was collected by an Ultra Receiver that allows for significant stacking of the data to reduce noise. Data were collected up to a time window of 12000 to 20000 and stacked by 1024 or 2048. The time sampling interval was 1000 ps. The step size was initially set to 3 m which will need to be corrected by the GPS data during processing. Data was saved and a new line was collected every 600-1000 traces to avoid data loss because of too large file size (!!). For the one 100 MHz profile close to Neumayer station, data was also collected with and Ultra Receiver and 4096 stacks and a time window of 4000 ns. For the data collection with the shielded antennae, data was collected with 8 stacks and up to a time of 2000 ns.

The SPM points were measured in two different ways.
\begin{itemize}
\item We drove to the point by
Hilux. We set up the system (ApRES and antenna) every time at each point. In
this method, the antennas were directly on the snow surface (fig. \ref{fig_SPM_surface}). The
coordinates and date of the measurements are written in table (\ref{Table_SPM_surface}).
\item We fixed the system (ApRES and antenna) inside the sleds and drove to the points by a
snowmachine (fig. \ref{fig_SPM_sled}). The coordinates and date of the measurements are written in
table (\ref{Table_SPM_sled}).
\end{itemize}

\section{MP\_A (profiling)}
\textbf{This section is written by Reza Ershadi}
(\href{mailto:mohammadreza.ershadi@uni-tuebingen.de}{\color{blue}{Email Me}})\\

The purpose here was to measure a 1000 m profile with 1.5 m spacing with all the
antennas positioned in the H direction. The system was directly connected to an
RTK GPS for precise positioning. We had many problems with this profile,
including the RTK signal, constant ApRES disconnection and typical rover
problems. Therefore, we could not finish the 1000 m profile with 1.5 m spacing.
The position of the profile and measured points are stored in our log files.\\

\textcolor{red}{Add detailed information about the 3 metal pieces. (?)}\\

The MP\_A profile has been done with two different methods.
\begin{itemize}
  \item We pulled the whole sled system manually for 100 m with 1.5 m spacing (fig. \ref{fig_MPA_manual}).
  \item We connected the sled system to the rover for a 1000 m profiling with 1.5 m spacing (fig. \ref{fig_MPA_rover})
\end{itemize}

\section{HF ApRES}
%: Data example, field picture, system setup and profile specifics
\label{SecHFApRES}

\subsection{System Overview}
The HF ApRES is a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar with 
a bandwidth of \SI{20}{\mega\hertz} to \SI{40}{\mega\hertz}.  It builds
upon the existing phase-coherent radar architecture of the ApRES\footnote{
  P. Brennan, L. Lok, K. Nicholls and H. Corr, "Phase‐sensitive FMCW radar 
  system for high‐precision Antarctic ice shelf profile monitoring", IET 
  Radar, Sonar \& Navigation, vol. 8, no. 7, pp. 776-786, 2014. Available: 
  10.1049/iet-rsn.2013.0053.
} but uses a modified radio front-end to operate at the reduced bandwidth
described.  In addition to the radar, the HF ApRES makes use of two 'wire-mesh
dipole' antennas - one each for the transmitter and receiver, and a 12V 
\SI{7}{\ampere\hour} lead-acid battery for power.  Both the HF ApRES radar unit 
and  the 'wire-mesh dipole' antennas had not been previously deployed on a 
polar ice shelf.  The objectives for the HF ApRES system were therefore to test
and validate its performance, then conduct a synthetic aperture radar survey of
the ice-ocean interface of the ice shelf.

\subsection{Testing Summary}
Testing was first conducted with the wire-mesh antennas to verify that they 
met the power transfer characteristics predicted through simulation.  Once
verified, a setup with the full HF ApRES system was configured and issues
were found with strong coupling between the transmit and receive antennas.
After further testing, it was found that broadside orientation of the antennas
and increased separation reduced the direct coupling between the antennas 
sufficiently for clean deramped signals to be recorded.

\subsubsection*{Wire-Mesh Dipole Antennas}
The wire-mesh dipole antennas were each tested with an SDRKits Vector Network
Analyzer (VNA) which allows for the measurement of the antenna reflection
coefficient ($\Gamma$).  The reflection coefficient is calculated from the
scattering parameters (s-parameters) measured by the VNA, where $S_{11}$ 
refers to the complex phasor ratio between the scattered and incident voltages from
the antenna.  The reflection coefficient can therefore be used to infer the 
ratio of incident power to the antenna which is 'accepted' and sets an upper
bound on the radiation efficiency.  The radiation efficiency of the antenna
is the ratio of incident power to the antenna that is actually radiated
rather than scattered back to the radar, or lost through conduction within the
antenna structure.  Radiation efficiency is difficult to measure in a field 
environment, hence the reflection coefficient is used to determine an upper
bound.

\begin{equation}
  \left|\Gamma\right|_{\texttt{dB}} = 20\log_{10} \left|S_{11}\right|
\end{equation}

The measured reflection coefficient of the wire-mesh dipole antennas from tests
on 28\textsuperscript{th} December is shown in Figure
\ref{FigureWireMeshNeumayer}.  Within the field of antenna engineering, a
reflection coefficient of less than \SI{-10}{\deci\bel} across the desired
signal bandwidth, i.e. greater than 90\% of power accepted by the antenna, is
deemed to be acceptable.  It can be seen that during initial tests conducted
\SI{500}{\metre} south-west of Neumayer Station the antennas have a measured
$\left|S_{11}\right|_{\textrm{dB}}$ of less than \SI{-10}{\deci\bel} across the
desired signal bandwidth of \SI{20}{\mega\hertz} to \SI{40}{\mega\hertz}.
Discussion regarding the antenna orientation can be below.

\paragraph*{Note:} After transport of the antennas from Neumayer III to the
grounding line camp, it was found that one of the centre-pin conductors on the
antenna arms had become loose, likely due to a dry solder joint.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{HF ApRES Radar}
Figure \ref{FigureHFApRESNoReceiveAntenna} shows a meaured test profile at
Neumayer Station where it was discovered that the receiving antenna of the HF
ApRES radar was disconnected.  A radar echo from is visible at approximately 
\SI{250}{\metre} depth, which corresponds with the expected thickness of the ice
shefl in the vicinity of the station.  The working explaination for the clear,
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) echo from the ice-shelf base with no receiving
antenna is that the echo is received by the transmitting antenna and coupled via
the 5V power rail to the receive RF path.  Other coupling paths, such as from the
transmit antenna to the mixer input or via a reflection from the disconnected
receiver port, are ruled out because they would not exibit the \SI{10}{\decibel}
step change in power with the value of the receive attenuator.  An alternative
explanation to be explored through simulation is that the received signal is
coupled through the coaxial cable connected to the receive port, acting as a
poorly matched whip antenna.

Reconnecting the receiver antenna, as shown in Figure
\ref{FigureHFApRESReconnectedAntenna} results in sigificant distortion visible
in the time-domain FMCW voltage signal, matched with the reduced SNR seen in the
range-power profile.  Overall power is increased relative to Figure
\ref{FigureHFApRESNoReceiveAntenna}, which gives confidence that the antenna was
not connected and has been successfully reconnected in the second dataset.  The
distortion is characteristic of 'clipping' where the recorded signal exceeds the
voltage range of the analogue-to-digital converter and the output is
subsequently 'clipped' to be within this range.  The evidence of clipping, at
low frequencies corresponding to short range echoes suggests that the direct
coulping between the antennas is higher than experienced from a previous
deployment of the HF ApRES radar on an Alpine glacier.

\paragraph*{Antenna orientation} was shown to influence coupling between
the transmit and receive antennas and the presence of high-power low frequency
signals in the deramped FMCW voltage signal.  Broadside refers to the antennas
positioned such that their phase centres are in line with the survey direction
and their longest axes are orthogonal to the survey direction.  Endfire refers
to the antennas positioned such that their longest axes are parallel to the
survey direction.  Experiemnts repeated at Neumayer Station (Figures
\ref{FigureHFApRESEndfireNeumayer} and \ref{FigureHFApRESBroadsideNeumayer}) and
the grounding line camp (Figures \ref{FigureHFApRESEndfireGroundingLine} and
\ref{FigureHFApRESBroadsideGroundingLine}) show that thwne antennas are aligned
in a 'broadside' configuration they exhibit reduced near-range coupling compared
to antennas separated by the same distance in an 'endfire' configuration.  The
HF ApRES was then reconfigured to be operated with the SubZero rover in a
broadside configuration, with an increased separation between the transmit and
receive antennas of \SI{40}{\metre}.

\subsection{Synthetic Aperture Radar Measurements}
The test site chosen for the HF ApRES SAR measurements was selected to coincide
with the series of basal terraces observed in the PulseEKKO data located in the
finely gridded region of Figure \ref{fig:overview}.  The HF ApRES system was
towed into position on 7\textsuperscript{th} January, configured according to
\ref{FigureHFApRESSubZeroConfiguration} and initial testing was conducted,
including the resolution of a software navigation issue with the rover.  Two
modes of measurement were conducted with the HF ApRES: a start-stop profile
where the instrument was repositioned in steps of \SI{1}{\metre} increments
along the desired profile direct, and kinematic profiles where the radar was set
to continuously measure while towed along the profile by the SubZero rover at
speeds of approximately \SI{0.7}{\metre\per\second} to
\SI{1}{\metre\per\second}.  For all measurement modes, the radar was configured
with the parameters listed in Table \ref{TableHFApRESMeasurementParams}.  The 
VV notation for the polarisation is consistent with that of the rover-towed VHF
system, however the precise polarisation response of the wire-mesh dipole
antennas has not been measured.

\subsubsection{Start-Stop Measurement}
On the 7\textsuperscript{th} January, \SI{192}{\metre} of the intended profile
was covered .  The rover was left in position overnight and the profile was
resumed to cover the remaining \SI{710}{\metre} over approximately 5 hours,
including aapproximately one hour of cumulative downtime. The Trimble R9s base
station was set up approximately \SI{40}{\metre} away from the profile at its
centre.  The RINEX files generated by the GNSS receivers at the base station and
on the rover were processed using the Canadian Spatial Reference System Precise
Point Positioning service\footnote{Full details can be found in
\texttt{Raw/RTKGPS/ApRES/Rover/HF/processing\_notes.md}} and are shown in Figure 
\ref{FigureHFApRESGNSS}.  There are tidal and ice flow components present in the
raw position data.  The ice velocity ($v$) is assumed constant along the length
of the profile from analysis of the \SI{120}{\metre} composite ITS\_LIVE data
for 2020.  The tidal components of the measured elevation were analysed using
the Tidal Fitting Toolbox \footnote{\url{https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19099-tidal-fitting-toolbox}}
but have not yet been validated with external data.  It is assumed that the
tidal components are also locally invariant and therefore the relative position
of the rover to the base is initially found through subtraction of the base
station coordinates from the rover coordinates. Phase and power of raw data is 
shown in Figure \ref{FigureHFApRESRaw}.

\end{figure}

Initial SAR processing of the dataset was performed using an interpolated 
$\textrm{sinc}$ routine using the MATLAB\copyright~ ApRESProcessor library\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/jonodhawkins/apresprocessor}} with a constant velocity
travel-time model using a dielectric permittivity for ice of $3.15$.  Antenna
positions were modelled to be \SI{50}{\metre} and \SI{10}{\metre} behind the
rover, in the direction of the image plane, as per the system setup indicated in
Figure \ref{FigureHFApRESSubZeroConfiguration}. For the
intial pass, bursts with low signal to noise ratios compared to the mean of the
dataset were excluded however further passes will select individual chirps from
these bursts to maximise the number of radar locations at which the
backprojection is performed.  Results of the backprojection in power and phase
are shown in Figure \ref{FigureHFApRESBackprojection}.

\subsubsection{Kinematic Measurement}
The kinematic measurements were made after the start and stop measurements along
the same profile to provide a comparative dataset and explore the use of the
ApRES radar as a mobile SAR.  Processing of the data is underway and not yet
included in this report.

The initial cApRES setup used cables of different lengths.  One-way travel times
for the cables were measured using an SDRKits VNA in time-domain reflectometer
(TDR) and network analyser (VNA) modes.  The `Yellow' cable was removed from the
initial setup and replaced with the `Double Earth' cable to reduce the
difference in cable travel time.  Final antenna cabling and assignments are
listed in Table \ref{TablecApRESCables}. 
The ApRES was configured to measure every \SI{3}{\hour}, alternating between 
mono-polarised (HH) and quad-polarised (HH, HV, VH, VV) measurements.  The RF
attenuator was set to \SI{23}{\decibel} and the AF gain was set to 
\SI{-14}{\decibel}.  The chirp settings are the default values with a sweep of
\SI{200}{\mega\hertz} to \SI{400}{\mega\hertz} over a period of \SI{1}{\second}.
